Tavern is a platform designed to streamline the tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) experience, addressing core pain points that both new and experienced players encounter. By integrating player and campaign discovery, session scheduling, inventory management, and potential NFC-enabled transaction tools, Tavern aims to become the premier hub for building, managing, and enhancing the social and organizational aspects of gameplay. With the TTRPG market on the rise and interest in it and related accessories growing, Tavern is poised to fill a critical niche in the gaming community.

As this is planned to be a startup, code will not be uploaded here but our sprints, objectives, and any other relevant information needed for the class will be.
